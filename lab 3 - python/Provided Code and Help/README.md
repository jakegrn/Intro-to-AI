CE213 Lab Exercise 3 – Provided Code (Python)



Students must implement 



* eight\_puzzle.PuzzleState.legal\_moves()
* eight\_puzzle.PuzzleState.apply()
* eight\_puzzle.heuristic()  (used by A\*)



The search algorithms (UCS and A\*) and output writing are provided so you can focus on:

* move generation
* heuristic design
* understanding UCS vs A\* behaviour



Run:
python solver\_8puzzle.py



Outputs:

* outputUniCost.txt
* outputAstar.txt
